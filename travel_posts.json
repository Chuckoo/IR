We stayed all night becayse there were two Japanese sisters, probably in their 50s who spoke decent English.  We got shit faced together as different people came and went.  One sister said she had to go walk her older sister to bed but stay because she'll be right back.  I thought, yeah ok, right. 10 minutes later she shows back up with some type of Japanese jungle juice mixed into a 2L plastic tea jug. Bartender was cool. \\n\\nShe invited us down the road to a bar where everyone seemed to know her and was proper sized.  Saw a few foreigners drinking with Japanese friends, super Mario was available to play on the big screen z so I figured what's the harm in tying one on.  She bought us a bunch of beer. I bought us whiskey.  We got obliterated.\\n\\nWife and I are in our early 30s.  I'll never forget getting hammered with the 2 Japanese middle aged sisters.

She exited the subway car while her little sister yelled \"No, wrong stop!\" and everyone in the train looked. It took a second but my wife realized what was happening and tried to get off too but she was slowed by the packed crowd (our kids had gone to sit down, so we were separated a bit.) She shouted \"Stay at that station!\" A young guy by the door heard the commotion and jumped out the doors right before they closed.\n\nEarly in the trip, we had told my daughter if we got separated to wait at the next station and we would come get her. So, my wife got out at the next stop with my younger daughter and I rode the subway going the other direction back a station. \n\nBack one station, I saw the young guy standing with my daughter. After checking if she was OK, I bowed deeply to the young guy and said \"Arigato Gozaimasu\". But he was barely paying any attention to me: Someone else had gotten off the subway with me, the young guy's friend I presume, and they were pointing at each other and laughing. The young guy must have texted his friend to tell him to come back a station as he had unexpectedly gotten off the train to help my daughter.\n\nMy daughter told me she had cried a bit but then the young guy used Google translate to have her try to call me but she  forgot to dial the country code so the call failed. He then tried to take her to the station master but the station was unmanned. Then they just came back to the platform to wait for me.\n\nThe four of us (young guy, his friend, my daughter and me) hopped back onto the train going in the original direction again. I tried talking to the guy but he didn't speak English and we couldn't pull out our phones for Google Translate as it was too crowded and we were both holding stuff.\n\nThank you young guy for providing company and comfort to my daughter when she got lost! I feel bad I was unable to express my gratitude appropriately due to language barrier. He was very nonchalant and humble about the whole thing but it really meant the world to me and her. Travelling in foreign places, when your are most confused and lost, you meet the nicest people.\n\nAfter that, my older daughter was really slow getting off the subway.","author":"DoomGoober","created_at":1704400592.0,"subreddit":"travel","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh41","comments":"{\"comments\": [{\"id\": \"kgc4m1k\", \"post_id\": \"18yn810\", \"comment\": \"I was in Tokyo with my wife and 3y son a few years ago.

It was a lovely place with very kind hosts, the house is quite fascinating, and our room was very warm even in winter (though the common spaces are pretty chilly when it's cold outside). When heading here, do keep in mind the village of Sakashita is pretty remote so the conveniences of the city may not be as easy to find. Reserving in advance for the only yakiniku place in town is recommended (though there's an excellent izakaya by the station), as it fills up fast! Extra little tip: there's also [a lovely bakery in Sakashita](https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/Restaurant_Review-g1015944-d13237271-Reviews-Tag_Bakery-Nakatsugawa_Gifu_Prefecture_Chubu.html). \\n\\n**Transportation**\\n\\nFrom japan-guide:\\n\\nTsumago is connected by infrequent buses with JR Nagiso Station, the closest train station. The one way trip takes about seven minutes and costs 300 yen (see timetable). Alternatively, a taxi ride costs about 1000 yen. You can also walk between Nagiso Station and Tsumago in about an hour along a marked walking trail.\\n\\nWith a few exceptions, most limited express trains between Nagoya or Nagano do not stop at Nagiso Station. Instead, transfer to a local train at Nakatsugawa or Kiso-Fukushima Station.\\n\\nNearby Magome can be reached from Tsumago by infrequent direct buses (see timetable) or by following the Magome-Tsumago Hiking Trail.\\n\\n**Travel itinerary**\\n\\nHere was our total trip itinerary. https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IZTclgq.png I set this trip up to combine a mix of the must-see spots, such as Kyoto, Tokyo and Miyajima, with rural places I had not been to much before (Hakone, Kiso Valley). This because it was the first trip to Japan for my fianc\\u00e9e, and my fourth. A little bit for both of us.\\n\\n**More links**\\n\\nFor those interested, [here is my album of photos from Japan](https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/noaceulemans\/sets\/72157657805551378), and [my full photostream](https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/noaceulemans\/).

Why do you use it?**\\n\\nBecause unlike most other photosharing platforms, Flickr minimally compresses images allowing you to share them in as close to their full quality as you can. Insta, in contrast, squashes images down to ridiculously poor quality - it caters for mass consumption at high speeds but the quality of the content takes an absolute beating. Flickr's also a neat community for good photography if you follow the right people and groups - and they're not out to get you to follow them, their YT, etc. or buy their prints constantly.

His dad boarded a flight from Thailand -> Tokyo, Japan -> USA. The flight to the USA (Airport is LAX) arrived on time but his dad never showed up during pick up.\n\nThe flight arrived at 6AM PST today, but his dad never showed up. They tried to see if customs had him detained but he's not there. The last text sent from dad was before he boarded his flight in Thailand which said \"Boarding plane now\". No other texts were received after that, and his phone is now off (or does not have a signal). There hasn't been any communication from dad at all.\n\nAirline security and the airlines itself won't give out information on whether he checked in or boarded the plane. And they cannot file a police report yet since they have to wait 48 hours to file a missing person's report. Someone suggested that they contact the US Embassy for help which they will do, but we were wondering if there are any other tips people may have that can help.\n\nHopefully he will just turn up tonight. Maybe his phone is out of batteries and there was a flight delay he couldn't communicate. But if that's not the case, what are some other resources that could help?\n\nThank you\n\nEDIT: (update)\n\nWork got busy and I was also coordinating with my friend on what was happening. All the replies were very helpful. They were able to file the police report, and his brother ended up calling the embassy for help. They didn\u2019t have any of his banking information (I didn\u2019t ask if his mom had any of those). However, in the middle of the chaos, they were able to hear from him. He said it was a miscommunication (flight changed (he was moved or he missed his flight, I didn\u2019t get the full details) and he thought the last message he had sent went through). He was having difficulty with cell service and on top of that, his phone had died. Once he was able to get those situated, he let his family know. \n\nMy friend\u2019s dad is old and forgetful, as old people are. While some people commented that \u201cpeople panic too much\u201d, this is what I ask, what if it\u2019s someone you love that went missing? Yes, there may be some dumb reason why he missed his flight or didn\u2019t communicate but at the end of the day, it could be something worse than that. My intention with this post was to get all the resources that we could to help just in case the latter (worse thing) happened. When people are worried or panicked, they often don\u2019t think about simple solutions or things that would make sense. I appreciate everyone who gave all the knowledge they could. \n\nAll your responses have helped me become more aware and also be more prepared when this happens. It probably barely happens to people who fly frequently, I know it has never happened to me (or anyone I know), and I appreciate all the people who helped me and my friend. Thank you guys. \n\nTLDR; Dad is safe and coming home tomorrow. Friend made sure he had all details and screenshots of his tickets.

How can I keep my enjoyment of travelling?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/travel\/comments\/z7fwq1\/mid_30s_travelling_for_the_first_time_since\/","content":"I'm mid 30s and currently on my first big trip since before the pandemic with some PTO I was told to use or lose by the end of the year as I built up so much with closed borders. I'm from Australia, went to Europe for 3 weeks and am in East Asia for a 10 days as a stopover before going home and am really noticing the difference between my early and mid 30s and am feeling really....pessimistic about what this means for the future since travelling is pretty much the only thing that brings colour to my life. \n\n1. I'm literally too old for economy. Gone at the days where I could sleep in the tiny amount of economy space you get, and I felt the consequences of being crammed into that tiny seat for about a week afterwards. I've woken up with the biggest pain in my neck today and exhaustion from barely sleeping doing Athens to Tokyo. I'm going to have to shell out for business class next time, but flight prices are crazy right now and it doesn't look like they will recover any time soon. \n\n2. I'm so......tired. I used to be able to spend 15 hours out doing things and only went home because public transport was about to stop running and I didn't want to pay for a $50+ cab ride home. Now I'm exhausted after just a few hours. I used to be able to sleep 4-5 hours and as long as I had one day in a week where I knocked out for a full 10 hours, it was fine, but not now. I sleep 10 hours a night after a big day. I never needed days where I did nothing either, now I do, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I'm going to need another nap soon and then do barely anything today, and feel like I'm wasting the day, and I will want this day back in the future when I'm back behind my desk living my dull wage slave life. \n\n3. Related, I find myself wishing I could have broken my trip up into smaller trips because of the exhaustion, but I'm Australian and it's just not an option with how long it takes it get anywhere and how much you pay for the flight. I almost *regret* adding Japan and Korea onto Europe because I'm exhausted, but if I booked them separately, it would have been a whole new set of flights.\n\n4. It's harder to find people my own age who want to meet up because they are all busy with partners and children and are no longer keen to hang out with a random they met in a bar last night or from the internet or an app. I'm too old to hang with 22 year olds because they have the energy I don't. \n\nI don't know where I'm going with this but I'm just sad. If I feel this exhausted and run down from a trip that would have been no problem for me 5 years ago, how am I going to feel when I'm 50? Are my travel days winding down?

Going to bed early feels so satisfying to me, even at home. I have absolutely zero desire to be out late. I'm not in my 20s anymore and thank god.

Take a nice walk, eat a nice meal, browse a local library, and go back to my room. I take classes here and there when I travel. Normally dance classes, but sometimes cooking classes too.

Places like NYC, LA, Las Vegas,  Miami, Boston, DC, and even at some point Tokyo, or Paris.  However my family ( mainly my mom ) does not want me to travel solo.  Now don\u2019t get me wrong I understand why they have concerns and worries especially as a young black man.  Tho at the same time I want to travel and while I do understand their concerns I still want to see the country while I\u2019m still young, and have a job with a ton of days off( it\u2019s a 2 2 3 schedule) and don\u2019t know how long this opportunity will last.

Well as far as friend I don\u2019t have a huge ton of them and the ones I do have don\u2019t just have the means to just up and leave for week to go someplace.  However the main reason I want to travel solo is because I hate traveling with people.  This wasn\u2019t much of a problem when I was kid\/teen but I\u2019m an adult now and want to do my own thing.  The trip that broke the camel\u2019s back was a trip to Las Vegas with my mom.  Now don\u2019t get wrong I love my mom but I fucking hated that trip , and not because of Las Vegas itself.  I loved Las Vegas from the lights, food, music, the vibe, not to mention I\u2019m a mountain biker and the whole city is surrounded by mountains and deserts.  The problem I had with this trip was my mom.  She wouldn\u2019t let me drive the rental car that I help pay for,  if we were out of the hotel room I had to be with her 24\/7,  and beside this one group MTB ride I did,  we basically did what she wanted to do.

Korean food feels way expensive for the quality tbh, when I can get the same quality at home for cheaper. Or possibly there not enough good Japanese places in my country, and maybe having more decent Korean restos heres. I do like Korea's culture of having a lot of sidedishes, but those probably what makes it more expensive. \\n\\n\\nNavigation - google maps in Japan is so good and can provide step by step guide on where to go, hurts my feet though, coming from a car centric country. Korea, due to war with the north, has outdated google map data and requires another app like naver to navigate, but they do have more escalators in their stations though. Long distance train quality was a step down in Korea I feel, specifically Busan one, but our trip also coincided with an event, with there not having enough seating for everyone on a long trip. Still way better from where I'm from with scooter hell and vehicular pollution almost everywhere, so can't really complain. \\n\\n\\nEnglish infrastructure - I think Japan has more available english signs and menus in my experience. Maybe it's line dependent, but their train announcements cycle through English as well, compared to Korea where there's none iirc. Koreans do have more english speaking people and sort of understands more, in terms of the average person. I also have a bit of bias that I personally feel hiragana and katakana are easier to read than hangul. \\n\\n\\nPeople - Korea was weird but in a good way, we were far from East Asian looking but people would try to talk with us in Korean all the time. We would tell them we couldn't understand, and they would either apologize, situationally laugh of the mistake or would try to talk in english, but in general more friendly feeling and helped us out even without asking when we looked lost once. Japan feels more cold and apathetic I feel. I get it since I once worked in customer service and also coming from a homogenous country. But when something goes off script they sort of shortcircuit, for a lack of a better term, would pause and look at you in panic or frustration, with you most of the time have to compromise. I'm an introvert so honestly prefer it, but IFF everything goes well.\\n\\n\\nCulture wise - I biasedly prefer Japan (games, anime, etc), but not enough to actually live there only for vacations. Korea feels really brand, class and looks conscious for me, expensive cars and luxury brands are everywhere, could never fit in with my broke ass there.\\n\\n\\nMight be the areas we went through, but both countries' shops and restaurants do kinda closes too early.

An older man nudged him and asked him to get up, then motioned for my wife to sit down. I\\u2019ll never forget that.\\n\\nJapanese is easier to pronounce for me than Korean. It took me all week to nail down how the hell to pronounce hello and thank you. Also the bowing is such an easy way to express gratitude, hello, goodbye. Easier to communicate in Japan. \\n\\nThere\\u2019s no sumo in Seoul.\", \"author\": \"HumusAmongUs\", \"created_at\": 1702608758.0}, {\"id\": \"kdfdso6\", \"post_id\": \"18ioq7z\", \"comment\": \"I lived in Korea for a year and have visited many times since, spent a total of about two years there.  Never lived in Japan but all visits combined have spent probably close to a year there now, although much more time outside of Tokyo than in the city.  Agree with pretty much everything you said.\\n\\nEdit - Actually I don't really find the nighttime drunkenness sketchy, but that's probably because I'm a bit of a drunk myself.\\n\\nOne thing that works in Korea's favour that I haven't seen anyone mention is how easy it is to learn hangul.  The first time I went there twenty-plus years ago I had a little pocket Korean phrasebook with a guide on how to read hangul; in the time it took me to fly from Vancouver to Incheon I had learned how to read all of the characters.  Obviously I didn't know the meanings of many words but being able to read the characters phonetically is huge in itself.
